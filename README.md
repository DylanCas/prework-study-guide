# DU Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project in my intro to the DU coding bootcamp. This was not only a learning experience for some new topics, but also a chance for me to apply what I have learned on my own before applying to DU. 
This project involved not only the learning experience of the modules I progressed though, but also offered to opportunity to apply new and prior knowledge in a practical way to what I aim to do for my future. I used and gained knowledge on HTML and CSS, while also picking up on Git/GitHub and JavaScript functions to build this project. 

## Installation

No installation required, only the URL. :)

## Usage

This study guide contains a few boxes of text containing my own notes on the topics of; HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
Within the webpage, you can open the Dev console, using "Command+Option=I" on Mac / "Control+Shift+I" on Windows, to open the console and view the JavaScript running and provides a random suggested section to study.
