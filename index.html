        <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains info about the webpage, for the browser.</li>
            <li>The body element contains all the visible content on a webpage.</li>
            <li>The Meta element item, 'UTF-8', is the most common for use in webpages.</li>
            <li>Elements nested within other elements are called child elements, within the parent elements.</li>
            <li>All content in a webpage is closed within "tags", usign the "<" and ">" symbols.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul><li>There are 3 ways to style a page using CSS:</li></ul>
          <ol type="number">
            <li>Inline CSS - Apply CSS style rules to a specific HTML tag. Useful for quick changes, but can only change one element at a time.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS style sheet - Can embed a style sheet nesting a "style" element within the "head" element.</li>
            <li>External CSS style sheet - Most common as it allows all the CSS rules to stay within a separate file. File is linked using a "link" element in the "head" element.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS dictates the colors, visual layout, and organization of the the page.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>CSS uses "class" and "element" selectors to assist with formatting.</li>
            <li>Class selector will apply styles to certain selected elements without affecting ALL of that element type.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
          <p>Git Flow</p>
          <ol type="numbers">
            <li>git add -A - Stages all changes that occured within the working branch.</li>
            <li>git commit -m "commit message" - Commits new entries/work to the GitHub repo, with a short descriptive message.</li>
            <li>git pull origin main - Once changes are added and committed locally, makes sure local branch is in sync with our working feature branch.</li>
            <li>git push origin branch name - Pushes commited changes to the remote repo. Usually ready to perform "Pull Request" and confirm "Merge" after this, within GitHub,</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>git status - Checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name - Creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>JavaScript Types:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Primitive values - All types except objects define "immutable values", values which can't be changed.</li>
              <li>Boolean type - Represents a logical entity that can have two values: true and false.</li>
              <li>Null type - Has exactly one value: null. Represents the intentional absence of any object value. Treated as 'false' for boolean operations.</li>
              <li>Undefined type - A variable that has not been assigned a value has the 'undefined'.</li>
              <li>Numeric types - ECMAScript has two build in numeric types: Number and BigInt - along with the related value NaN.</li>
              <li>Number type - Double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value.</li>
              <li>BigInt type - A numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for numbers.</li>
              <li>NaN - "Not a Number", typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as number. It is also the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.</li>
              <li>String type - Used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the string occupies a position in the string. The first element is at index 0, next at index 1, and so on. The length of a string is the number of elements in it.</li>
              <li>Symbol type - A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an object property. In some programming languages, symbols are called "atoms".</li>
              <li>Objects - In Comp Sci, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referencede by an identifier.</li>

              <br>
              <li>Order matters when using JavaScript. The script file should load top to bottom, as that is the way it is read. However, certain conditional statements can alter or interrupt this flow somewhat.</li>
